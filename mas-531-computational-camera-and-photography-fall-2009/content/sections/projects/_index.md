Project Goals
-------------

The final project for the class should be novel and cool: hands-on with optics, illumination, sensors, masks. We can provide cameras, lenses, electronics, projectors, etc. Students will produce a conference quality paper describing the project, and we devote the last class period to presentations of the projects, followed by awards for the best projects.

Results
