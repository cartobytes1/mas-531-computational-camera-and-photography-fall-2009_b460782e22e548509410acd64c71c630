Mid-term Exam Preparation
-------------------------

### Structure

*   2 hours
*   Open book
    *   But don't just print all the slides
*   Types of questions
    *   Emphasis on testing concepts
    *   Draw a diagram to explain X
    *   Very simple calculations
    *   Comparisons
    *   Open ended questions (essay)
    *   Homework insights
*   Preparation
    *   Read all the slides
    *   Read related papers: look at 'contributions', 'limitations', 'future work' and 'conclusions' sections carefully
